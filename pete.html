<p>"The zoo is just packed today my friend"</p>
<p>"I have it on good authority that the lesser primates who come to watch us are up to no good"</p>
<p>"Don't trust them Harambe. Remember what I told you about them being half lizard"</p>
<p>"Why did I tell you about the time they took me away and probed.."</p>
<p>"Okay okay, no more crazy theories again today Pete" You interpt before it gets too weird</p>
<p>"Well I should tell you that my sisters, Lily and Bertha, are over at the moat entertaining those weird primates. I know you love those bald apes but they are nothing but trouble, mark my words Harambe!"</p>
<p>"More importantly Zookeeper Joe is already handing out bananas. You should get over there before they run out"</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>So whats it going to be? Head over to the moat to perform for the bald primates or go get some bananas from Zookeeper Joe?</p>
